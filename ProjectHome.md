If your auto-uploading camera or photo import tool has been importing photos to your computer based on date taken, it is likely that you have the same situation that I do. I have a ton of folders named by date taken. This creates a mess of folders with names like this
2005-05-03
2005-05-04
2005-06-01
and also because over the years different things format the date taken differently I also have folders like
05-03-2005
05-04-2005
and
20110801
20110802
and maybe they have different separator characters. Some use "-" some use "_" some don't use any and this is a huge mess._

I want a script to take a mess of folders and move the photos into
year\month directory structures.
This way I will only have photos under 12 folders for each year. Although in order for the directories to show up in order I have to name the months like this:
1-January
2-February
...
12-December

so this script does that.
